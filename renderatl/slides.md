Sooo, earlier this year I embarked on a journey to learn more about AI and ML and gain some foundational knowledge in the field. I then started to learn about and build with large language models (and even built my own custom model) and I'm here to share some of that knowledge with you today.

# Large Language Models

- Have you used one before? ðŸ¤”

- Do you know how they work? ðŸ¤¯

<!--

Now how many of you have heard of LLMs before?
Now, how many of you have used an LLM before?
And how many of you actually understand what an LLM is and how they work?

# What is an LLM?

It's something to behold!

<!--
When we tak about AI and their elationship with LLMs, we must look at the sort of hierachal relationship that exists between the two.

AI can be considered as Mother - the parent of Machine Learning, Deep Learnig, Natural Language Processing, Generative AI and then we get to Large Language Models.

Without AI at the forefront and the advancements made in AI, we would not have the LLMs that we have today.

There is going to be a lot of vocabulary that I wont be v=covering today but at the heart of Language Models is generative AI. 

Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that is capable of generating new content, such as images, text, or music. It is used in a variety of applications, such as chatbots, language translation, and text generation.

Some of the most common types of generative AI are:
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Large Language Models (LLMs)

We'll be focusing on Large Language Models today.

A large langage model is a type of generative AI model that can generate human-like text.

To get to the point of having a large language model however, we must first understand the building blocks of these models - transformers.

# The Langchain effect


<!--
Langchain is a framework that was developed to make it easier for any developer to build their own LLM powered application. It currently suports 2 languages - Python and Javascript.
