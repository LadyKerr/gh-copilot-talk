# Code Smarter not Harder with GitHub Copilot ðŸ¤–

## What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot is an AI pair programmer that helps you write code faster. GitHub Copilot draws context from the code youâ€™re working on, suggesting whole lines or entire functions. It helps you quickly discover alternative ways to solve problems, write tests, and explore new APIs without having to tediously tailor a search for answers on the internet. GitHub Copilot is powered by OpenAI GPT-4(?), a new AI system created by OpenAI.

You can use it in your favorite editor - Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, many JetBrains IDEs (Pycharm, RubyMine, WebStorm, IntelliJ and more), Neovim and also works with Azure Data Studio.

You will install the AI assistant as an extension and if you're using jetbrains IDEs, you will install it as a plugin.
